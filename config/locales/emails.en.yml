        we would like to thank you very much for your submission. We were
        surprised and overwhelmed by the sheer amount of the high quality
        submissions that we received.

        After an extensive selection process we unfortunately had to reject your
        submission

        We can assure you that this was not an easy decision to make.
        We hope we can still  welcome you at the conference.
